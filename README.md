This project is a collection of scripts to download and organize data from the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) database. "1_download_corpora.R" downloads a specified set of CHILDES corpora. "2_get_adj_uses.R" analyzes the files in each corpus to identify all adjective uses. These uses are organized into a dataframe which is then written to disk.
